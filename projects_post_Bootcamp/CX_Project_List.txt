** I WANT: There to be one BASE EXTENSION that can accept (JS, HTML, CSS) like JSBIN
        -This will allow for custom code to be drag and dropped vs. having each person need a separate extension
        -I also have to test out in what ways will that code be accepted ( all together or one textarea for each language?)
        -Build the code that takes that coppied code and makes it part of the running/persistent code
