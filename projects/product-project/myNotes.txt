1. HOW TO BUILD THE SEARCH AND FILTER

https://matdavis2121-github-io-matdavis2121.c9users.io/projects/product-project/.notes/directions.html

A. SEARCH
    a. search by ANYTHING?
        1. first just search the description then apply it to most text
        2. when you search, make the highlighted text receive a span that highlights it?
        3. when it doesn't match, remove the span
        4. Make sure it's only keywords
            -black, iphone, samsung, 4.7 inch
        5. if it's not a keyword, display a div tip (please search for a keyword, ex. )
        6. for each product turn the TYPE, DESC, COLOR, AVAILABLE COLORS, SPECS, all into 1 string
            -Use that string word search?
            -OR copy and past only the words we want

B. FILTER
    a. filter by 
        1. type ( phone || case)
        2. desc ( iphone || samsung )
        3. price ( low > high || high > low)
        4. availableColors - will have to filter out colors IF phone is filtered
        **INSTEAD: of filter out, we'll allow these options to switch colors
            1. (Black Sapphire | Gold | White | Blue Topez)
            2. (Black Sapphire | Gold | White | Blue Topez)
            3. (Black | Gold | White Pearl)
            4. (Black | Gold | White | Clear | Red)
            5. (Black| Gold Platinum| White Pearl| Emerald Green)
            6. 
        5. PHONE/COVER FILTER
            1. if phone button clicked
                a. filter to only show phones
                b. change button style
                    b1. animation
                    b2. colors
                    b3. class changes (add/remove code)
            2. if case button clicked
                a. filter to only show cases
                b. change button style
                    b1. animation
                    b2. colors
                    b3. class changes (add/remove code)
            
            3. if both clicked then what?
                a. filters are reset
                b. short message is animated to show reset

2. WORKFLOW IMPROVEMENTS
    A. Creating new jQuery wrapped elements
        1. assign jQuery wrapped var
        2. TEST: reuse that var in the current section vs. typing the newly assigned id
        3. 
    B. Creating dynamic Functions from the start
    C. Lessons
        1. Don't forget to confirm the js and html files are being found (Use the console)
        2. Any errors in the JSON file won't be reported so keep that in mind
