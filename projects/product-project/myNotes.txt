TODOLIST
0. Make search extend to all
1. Make search and filter work together
2. tighten loopholes in search
3. extend the search keywords to the other properties
4. if all product-divs are set to none then display a div   
    NO PRODUCTS MATCHED YOUR SEARCH, PLEASE TRY AGAIN
5. Show the number of products that match the results
6. When the phones are filtered, show the total amount
    -can check the datasets and the display values

7. When the cases are filtered, show the total amount
8. I need to build a function that takes a argument of the highlight searches index
    in order to find the other matches for those searches
9. full test out map and recursion

1. HOW TO BUILD THE SEARCH AND FILTER

https://matdavis2121-github-io-matdavis2121.c9users.io/projects/product-project/.notes/directions.html

A. SEARCH
    a. search by ANYTHING?
        1. first just search the description then apply it to most text
        2. when you search, make the highlighted text receive a span that highlights it?
        3. when it doesn't match, remove the span
        4. Make sure it's only keywords
            -black, iphone, samsung, 4.7 inch
        5. if it's not a keyword, display a div tip (please search for a keyword, ex. )
        6. for each product turn the TYPE, DESC, COLOR, AVAILABLE COLORS, SPECS, all into 1 string
            -Use that string word search?
            -OR copy and past only the words we want

B. FILTER
    a. filter by 
        1. type ( phone || case)
        2. desc ( iphone || samsung )
        3. price ( low > high || high > low)
        4. availableColors - will have to filter out colors IF phone is filtered
        **INSTEAD: of filter out, we'll allow these options to switch colors
            1. (Black Sapphire | Gold | White | Blue Topez)
            2. (Black Sapphire | Gold | White | Blue Topez)
            3. (Black | Gold | White Pearl)
            4. (Black | Gold | White | Clear | Red)
            5. (Black| Gold Platinum| White Pearl| Emerald Green)
            6. 
        5. PHONE/COVER FILTER
            1. if phone button clicked
                a. filter to only show phones
                b. change button style
                    b1. animation
                    b2. colors
                    b3. class changes (add/remove code)
            2. if case button clicked
                a. filter to only show cases
                b. change button style
                    b1. animation
                    b2. colors
                    b3. class changes (add/remove code)
            
            3. if both clicked then what?
                a. filters are reset
                b. short message is animated to show reset

2. WORKFLOW IMPROVEMENTS
    A. Creating new jQuery wrapped elements
        1. assign jQuery wrapped var
        2. TEST: reuse that var in the current section vs. typing the newly assigned id
        3. 
    B. Creating dynamic Functions from the start
    C. Lessons
        1. Don't forget to confirm the js and html files are being found (Use the console)
        2. Any errors in the JSON file won't be reported so keep that in mind
        
3. CSS, STYLES, FEATURES
    A. NAV
        1. drop down for phone types
        2. drop down for case types     -YES
        3. images in the dropdowns???   -YES
        4. dropdowns on hover?          -YES
    B.
